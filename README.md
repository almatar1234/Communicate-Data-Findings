# Communicate-Data-Findings

# Project Overview:
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings will be through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

# Project Requirements:
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

* NumPy

* pandas

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* "201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv" (This was not uploaded on this repository due to its huge size, I have uploaded the cleared version only).

# Key Insights:
After wrangling the gathered dataset, I have divided my invistigating into 3 parts; Univariant, Bivariant and Multivariant.

**Univariant**

Here, I am exploring the distribution of a single attribute, one at a time.

1- The frequency of trips riding times in seconds is about 500 seconds.

2- The frequency of trips riding times in minutes is about 5 to 10 minutes. 

3- Male riders apear to be more than female and "other" gender.

4- Subscribers are using the bikes more than customers do.

5- Thursdays appear to be the most frequent days that people prefer to ride the bikes on, wherease Sundays and Saturdays are the least.

**Bivariant**

Here, I am exploring the relationship between 2 variables:

1- The younger the member, the less trip duration he/she will ride the bike.

2- All genders have the same average duration time, except for male, they have less duration time.

3- Males seem to like riding on Thursdays, Female also like Thursdays and like to ride on Tuesdays. Others gender seem to ride on Thursdays and Wednesdays.

4- 8:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 17:00 PM and 18:00 PM seem to be the peak hours for Subscribers. 8:00 AM, 16:00 PM and 17:00 PM are the peak hours for Cutomers riders.

**Multivariant**

Here, I am exploring the relationship between more than 2 variables (3 in my case):

1- Most of the riders are male and they are ranging from 20 to 80 years old. Males tend to finish their rides in shorter time than females do.

2- subscribers are more than cutomers. However, male subscribers and customers prefer to ride on Thursdays and Tuesdays, So do the females. Others gender prefer Thursdays and Wednesdays.


# Project Findings:
After finishing the analysis and visualization, I have concluded that:

1- Men ride bikes more than women.

2- Subsrcibers have the highest frequncy than Customers.

3- Riders prefer week days over weekends.

4- The average riding time is 10 minutes.
