# Communicate-Data-Findings

# Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings will be through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

# Project Findings
After finishing the analysis and visualization, I have concluded that:
1- Men ride bikes more than women.

2- Subsrcibers have the highest frequncy than Customers.

3- Riders prefer week days over weekends.

4- The average riding time is 10 minutes.
